# Enabling I2S

The default ALSA sound devices supported by the Raspberry Pi 3 are PWM audio output jack and HDMI output.
To run this demonstration I2S input and output needs to be enabled. _The goal is to use a simple I2S
interface that does not depend on a particular DAC or CODEC device that requires configuration over I2C or SPI._

##### RPi <-> Dummy_SND_Card <-> I2S/PCM Data Generator

ASoC basically splits an embedded audio system into 3 components:

> `Codec driver`: The codec driver is platform independent and contains audio controls, audio interface capabilities, codec dapm definition and codec IO functions.    
> `Platform driver`: The platform driver contains the audio dma engine and audio interface drivers (e.g. I2S, AC97, PCM) for that platform.     
> `Machine driver`: The machine driver handles any machine specific controls and audio events. i.e. turning on an amp at start of playback.

To avoid recompilation of the Linux kernel a loadable kernel module is used.  
This enables the driver for the I2S peripheral inside the BCM2708 device to be loaded dynamically.

A full description of how to do this can be found [here](http://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=44&t=91237), however a brief
summary of the required steps, found to work on a clean copy of Debian Jessie shipped
with ``Noobs``, is described here:


First, update the Raspbian Linux distribution to the latest version (version 4.4.13v7 tested).
This may take a few hours::

       sudo apt-get update
       sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Before proceeding with the next steps, ensure you have re-booted your Raspberry Pi so that it is
running the latest version of Raspbian that you have just downloaded. This can be done using
the following command::

       sudo reboot

Next, we need to enable I2S in device tree. To do this, edit the file `/boot/config.txt`
to remove the comment on line 47:

       dtparam=i2s=on

The sound card driver depends on the I2S peripheral and Direct Memory Access Controller
modules which need to be added to  file. To do this, add the following lines to ``/etc/modules``
using your favorite text editor prefixed with ``sudo`` to ensure super user privileges:

       snd_soc_bcm2708
       snd_soc_bcm2708_i2s
       bcm2708_dmaengine

Next, download the kernel source (this may also take a long time to download and extract).
The source download script requires the installation of two helper applications that are not
installed by default. The installation of these is included below:

       sudo apt-get install bc
       sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
       git clone http://github.com/notro/rpi-source
       cd rpi-source
       python rpi-source
       cd ..

Now we have the kernel source downloaded, we can modify the driver source and build the
modules needed to enable I2S. We require two modules --- one called ``loader`` which instantiates
the sound-card module and the other is ``asoc_simple_card`` which is the sound card driver itself.

For further information on building and loading modules under Linux the link below provides
a [useful reference](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md).
Next we need to build the simple sound card driver:

       mkdir snd_driver
       cd snd_driver
       cp ../linux/sound/soc/generic/simple-card.c ./asoc_simple_card.c

The following is required *only if* the codec is being wired as a slave device on the I2S bus.

> The file needs a small modification to work around a bug (uninitialized BCLK ratio, causing the
> default of 100 bit clocks per I2S frame rather than the required 64 bit). To make this correction,
> at the end of function ``asoc_simple_card_dai_init`` around line number 213, add the following
> source lines:    
>     
>       ret = snd_soc_dai_set_bclk_ratio(cpu, 64);     
>       pr_alert("BCLK ratio set to 64!\n");

Make sure that line 29 is changed as shown below to ensure the **_Raspberry Pi 3 is the I2S Slave and the Codec is the Master_**

       .daifmt = SND_SOC_DAIFMT_I2S | SND_SOC_DAIFMT_NB_NF | SND_SOC_DAIFMT_CBM_CFM,

Copy the below contents into ``Makefile`` again ensuring that the indent is a tab character
rather than spaces::

```makefile
obj-m := loader.o
KDIR := /home/bhargav/Coder/raspberrypi/linux
PWD := $(shell pwd)
default:
        $(MAKE) ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) modules
clean:
        $(MAKE) ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- -C $(KDIR) SUBDIRS=$(PWD) clean

```

And finally build the module and copy it into the RPi

      modinfo /home/bhargav/Coder/scratch-pad/raspberrypi/i2s/loader.ko

To verify that the I2S audio device driver module has been loaded and is accessible,
you run the following command::

       arecord -l

This should generate a list of available ALSA captures devices something like this::

       **** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
       card 1: sndrpisimplecar [snd_rpi_simple_card], device 0: simple-card_codec_link snd-soc-dummy-dai-0 []
         Subdevices: 1/1
         Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

The physical sound card device presents a stereo I2S device to Linux. _However, some Voice Assistant software
such as Amazon's Alexa, requires access to a mono capture device. **To present the stereo sound card as a mono**
device it is necessary to create a virtual mono capture device connected to the physical stereo capture device
in ALSA. The microphone audio sent from the Microphone is a mono signal repeated on both stereo channels and
so either channel will provide the required signal. The virtual mono capture device then needs to be set as
the default device so that the client software picks it first when searching for input devices._

To setup the virtual capture device, modify the file ``.asoundrc`` found in the home directory as follows::

       pcm.monocard {
         type plug
         slave.pcm "plughw:1,0"
         slave.channels  2
         slave.rate 16000
       }

       ctl.monocard {
         type hw
         card 1
         device 0
       }

       pcm.!default {
          type asym
          playback.pcm {
             type hw
             card 0
          }
          capture.pcm {
             type plug
             slave.pcm "monocard"
          }
       }

       ctl.!default {
          type asym
          playback.pcm {
             type hw
             card 0
          }
          capture.pcm {
             type plug
             slave.pcm "monocard"
          }
       }

The above configuration keeps the default playback device as the 3.5mm jack on the Raspberry Pi however
this can be changed to the I2S bus by changing the contents of for both
``pcm.!default {`` and ``ctl.!default {`` so that the ``playback.pcm {`` entries match ``capture.pcm``.

To apply the changes made in ``.asoundrc`` and enable the virtual capture device either reboot the
Raspberry Pi or use the following command::

       sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart

Following the instructions given so far will enable the I2S soundcard in the current session. To make
it available after reach reboot, it is necessary to load the modules at boot time. You can do this by
adding a boot-time cron job to run the following script. Save this script as ``load_i2s_driver.sh``
in your home directory::

       cd ~
       sudo insmod snd-soc-simple-card-utils.ko
       sudo insmod snd-soc-simple-card.ko
       sudo insmod loader/loader.ko

The script can be auto-run at boot time by adding the following line in the editor window that
appears after typing ``crontab -e``

@reboot /home/pi/load_i2s_driver.sh
